## What is CosmaSense?

CosmaSense is an open-source local file indexing and search engine that finds your files using natural language queries. It runs 100% locally on your device, giving you powerful semantic search capabilities without compromising your privacy.

Think of it as **Google for your file system** - no more digging through folders or trying to remember exact filenames. Just search for what's in the file, and CosmaSense will find it.
