## Installation

Get CosmaSense installed and start searching your files in three simple steps.

### Step 1: Download and Install

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone from GitHub">
    CosmaSense is currently available in alpha testing through GitHub.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cosmasense/cosma.git
    cd cosma
    ```

    <Note>macOS app coming soon! Currently available as CLI and TUI.</Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="download" title="Install Dependencies">
    CosmaSense requires Python 3.8+ and uses a monorepo structure with shared dependencies.

    ```bash
    # Install Python dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # For local AI models (optional)
    pip install ollama
    ```

    <Tip>You can use either local models (Ollama) or cloud providers (OpenAI) for AI features.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Start the Backend

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="server" title="Launch the Backend Server">
    The backend runs as a daemon process on port 60534.

    ```bash
    # Start the backend server
    cosma serve
    ```

    The backend will:
    - Initialize the SQLite database with vector search capabilities
    - Start watching for file changes
    - Listen for search requests on `http://localhost:60534`

    <Tip>The server runs in the background and auto-restarts on crashes.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="folder-open" title="Watch Your First Directory">
    Tell CosmaSense which directory to index:

    ```bash
    # Watch a directory (e.g., Downloads)
    curl -X POST http://localhost:60534/api/watch/directory \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"path": "/Users/yourname/Downloads"}'
    ```

    CosmaSense will automatically:
    1. Discover all files in the directory
    2. Parse them using MarkItDown
    3. Generate AI summaries and keywords
    4. Create embeddings for semantic search
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Start Searching

<Accordion icon="magnifying-glass" title="Launch the TUI">
  Use the Terminal UI to search your files:

  ```bash
  cosma search
  ```

  The TUI provides:
  - Real-time search as you type (0.5s throttled)
  - Live indexing status updates via SSE
  - File preview and selection (fzf-style)

  **Try searching:**
  - "tax documents from 2023"
  - "python code with API calls"
  - "meeting notes about project roadmap"

  <Tip>Press Enter on a file to print its path (useful for piping to other commands).</Tip>
</Accordion>

## Quick Usage Examples

<CodeGroup>

```bash TUI Search
# Interactive terminal search
cosma search

# Type your query in natural language
# Select a file with Enter to get its path
```

```bash API Search
# Direct API search (GET request with query parameters)
curl "http://localhost:60534/api/search/stream?query=meeting+notes&limit=10"
```

```bash Watch Directory
# Add a new directory to watch
curl -X POST http://localhost:60534/api/watch/directory \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"path": "/path/to/directory"}'
```

```bash Get Watched Directories
# List all watched directories
curl http://localhost:60534/api/watched-directories
```
