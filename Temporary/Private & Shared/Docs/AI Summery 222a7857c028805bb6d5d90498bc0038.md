# AI Summery

# Goal:

---

- Reduce the length of the file ocntent, summerize improtant stuff into a short paragraph
- Resemble the overall info inside the file, including important keyworkds
- Also able to summerize folders
- Run by both local and online LLM models

# Tech Stack:

---

- liteLLM → LLM backends
- ollama → local backend
- openai api → LLM providor
- hugging face → embedding models
- pytorch → local LLM
- sqlite → Vector store
- pydantic → Formal models for type checking
- langchain/langgraph → AI pipline
- env → load config
- pytest → testing
- Structlog → Log

# I/O design

---

Input: 

- Object with file name, date, format, and content

Output: 

- Object with fine name, data, format, vector of the file, AI summery, and the vector index of the AI summary

# File structure:

a single python file:

1. check input object with model
2. generate ai summery
3. index the ai summery
4. return
