## Directory Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `indexing` | Currently processing files in this directory |
| `complete` | All files have been processed (some may have failed) |
| `error` | Critical error occurred with this directory |
| `watching` | Monitoring for file changes (post-initial-index) |

<Note>
Directories continue to be watched even after initial indexing is complete. The backend monitors for file changes and automatically re-indexes modified or new files.
</Note>

<Tip>
Use this endpoint to check indexing progress before running searches. Searches only return results for files that have been fully indexed.
