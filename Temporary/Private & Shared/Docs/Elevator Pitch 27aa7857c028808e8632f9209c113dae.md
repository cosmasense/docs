# Elevator Pitch

- What is the problem you are solving?
    - People produce too much files in different places yet there’s no efficient way to organize them.
- What is the solution you came up with?
    - We design a AI powered file system that helps user lookup/organizing files.

    - Google of ur file system
- What's your unfair advantage? Background, degree, internships, skills, team, network, location...
    - LLM development experience, OS, etc
- Channels. How are we getting your product to your customers? Internet link, Amazon shipping, hand delivery...
    - links
- Customer Segments. Tell me about your ideal customer. Why are they the right fit? Why do they need your product?
    -

- Revenue Streams. How do you get paid? By deal, weekly/monthly/annual subscriptions, per usage...
- Elevator Pitches
    - Hello, my name is Caleb/Ethan/Jackson. I am one of the founders of Solar Flow. We solve the problem of finding messy files in discrete places and file organization . Think of it like Google search for your files. Right now we’re developing a product to ship to users.
    - Hi, I'm [Name], co-founder of Solar Flow. We're building Google search for your personal files: one search bar that instantly finds anything on your device. We're currently in the development stage and looking to ship our first version to users soon

Two Minute Pitch

Hi everyone! We're Solar Flow.

I'm Caleb, a **rising senior** at **UW Madison** studying **Comp Sci** and **Math**. 
I’m Ethan, a **rising junior** at **UW Madison** studying **Comp Sci** and **Comp Engineering**.
We also have a third team member who couldn’t join us today.

**How's your downloads folder?** There's a good chance it’s a huge mess with files everywhere and no structure for finding them, which reveals a **fundamental flaw** with how we think about files.

To break it down:
First, we're **spending way too much time** on file management, both **setting up systems** and  **maintaining them** as they **break down**.
Second, **file search is frustrating**. You know that file exists, you can even picture it, but the system can only find it if you **remember the exact filename**.
Third, we're **asking** **humans to think like computers**. File systems expect everyone to think in **rigid hierarchies**, and that's just **not** how most people's **minds work**.

So here's our solution.
We use **AI tools** to **completely automate** every aspect of **file management** by giving each user an **on-device, AI-powered file assistant**.
For example, if you need to find something on your system? Just **search by what's in the file**. No need to remember exact filenames or where you put something. Sort of like a Google for your file system.
We currently have a **working prototype** that we **presented to OpenAI** in August and are in the process of **developing our MVP**. We’re hoping to refine our idea into a something people are excited to use.
